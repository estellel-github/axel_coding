/* Task 8:
    Exercise:
     1. Define an array of objects where each object represents a person with properties name and age.
     2. Write a JavaScript function named addDecade that uses map() to add a new
    property ageInTenYears to each person object, which should be their current age plus ten.
     3. Use an arrow function within map() to handle the transformation.
 4. Return the new array and print it to the console.
    Expected output:
     [
        { "name": "Alice", "age": 25, "ageInTenYears": 35 },
        { "name": "Bob", "age": 30, "ageInTenYears": 40 },
        { "name": "Charlie", "age": 35, "ageInTenYears": 45 }
    ] */
