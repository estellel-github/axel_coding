/* 2. Exercise: Movie Night Decision Maker:
● Description: Write a function decideMovie() that takes two
parameters: age (number) and isParent (boolean)
● If the person is under 18 or if they are a parent with a child,
recommend a family-friendly movie; otherwise, recommend a
movie suitable for their age. (You can either google a
family-friendly and age-appropriate movie, or just write
‘family-friendly movie’ and ‘age-appropriate movie).
● Implement this function twice:
○ Once using an if-else statement.
○ Once using a ternary operator.
● Which method do you prefer? */
