/* 1. Exercise: Fitness Tracker (Together)
● Description: Create a function exerciseRoutine() that takes two
parameters: dayOfWeek (string) and timeOfDay (string). Based on
the parameters, recommend an exercise routine for the day and
time.
● Example:
○ On Mondays, recommend a morning yoga session.
○ On Wednesdays, recommend an evening cardio workout.
● Note. In case you get the drift and want to save time, there can
be several days that return “Rest day”.🙂 */
